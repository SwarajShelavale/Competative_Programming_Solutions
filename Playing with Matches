//Playing with Matches     Problem Code: MATCHES

/*Chef's son Chefu found some matches in the kitchen and he immediately starting playing with them.
The first thing Chefu wanted to do was to calculate the result of his homework — the sum of A
and B, and write it using matches. Help Chefu and tell him the number of matches needed to write the result.
Digits are formed using matches in the following way:


Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T
denoting the number of test cases. The description of T

test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A
and B

    

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — 
the number of matches needed to write the result (A+B).

Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤A,B≤106

Example Input

3
123 234
10101 1010
4 4

Example Output

13
10
7

Explanation

Example case 1: The result is 357
We need 5 matches to write the digit 3, 5 matches to write the digit 5 and 3 matches to write the digit 7

Example case 2: The result is 11111
. We need 2 matches to write each digit 1, which is 2⋅5=10 matches in total.*/
